# Self-Driving Car Simulator

## Overview

This simulator uses a genetic machine learning algorithm to create the "brain" of a self-driving car.

## Instructions

1. **Run the Simulator**
   - Open `index.html` in a browser. Or click on this link: https://riyazrmp.github.io/Self-Driving-Car-Simulator/

2. **Initial Run**
   - The simulation starts with 200 AI cars.
   - Once all cars have collided with traffic or road borders, click "Save" to preserve the brain of the car that traveled the farthest.

3. **Subsequent Rounds**
   - Reload the web page.
   - Out of the 200 AI cars, 199 will have a 20% variation from the best brain of the previous round.
   - Wait for all cars to collide, then click "Save" to store the best car brain.

4. **Repeat**
   - Continue this process until you develop an optimized self-driving car.

## Goal

Iterate until achieving a highly effective self-driving car model.
